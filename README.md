I've never done a ReactJS project before, even more using NextJS. So, I'll focus on doing what I already know delivering the needs one-by-one till I get a satisfatory result. 

Project intended to be shipped until Monday (27/03/23), let's see what I can do in so little time.

Today its Friday and I've completed the main FE part today and now I'm going to focus on the BE with the NestJS app. I'm happy with the already achieved result, in such little time I could create a beautiful app entirely from my mind in a stack that I'm not comfortable with and even implementing an API that I've never used before, that is Stripe's one.

I think that will be easier since I've already done [another robust API](https://github.com/pmattheew/forfaitbank-api) with authentication, CRUD operations and tests using NestJS for a side project, that initially was an admissional test as well.
